            My official name is Juanjuan Zhao. In workplace, people also call me Jennifer which is my English name.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am an {selfIntroText}
          </p>
          <p>
            I basically spent 10 years in China working in translation industry, out of which 7 years were 
            technology focused, including 3 years as a web development manager and 4 years as a senior software engineer. 
            All my efforts in the period were to build an automated system to help innovate traditional translation 
            workflow and enhance core competitiveness of Cross Language.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016, I decided to pursue a master&apos;s degree in computer science at University of Texas at Dallas, 
            and graduated in December 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting from August 2017, I resumed work as a web developer using modern Javascript frameworks, Node, React, 
            Typescript, etc. While being fond of the elegancy and possibilities of modern Javascript frameworks, 
            I quickly grew into a senior software engineer with extensive exposure to web technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also I found myself well adapted to the work environment in US, in particular for communication in workplace, 
            time management, and team leading, based on my previous management experience in Cross Language.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;ve learned tremendous values by getting involved in agile development tools such as Jira; 
            CICD tools and technologies such as Heroku, Docker, Wercker, and Assembla; version management tools 
            such as Git and SVN; Scaling tools and platforms such AWS autoscaling, GCP, and Kubernetes. 
            Also I highly appreciate modern Javascript libraries which make possible efficient development and 
            clean code: React, ESLint, Webpack, Babel, Styled Components, React Hooks, ES6, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m currently open for permanent positions (no contract) in {futureLocation} as a senior software engineer, 
            senior full-stack engineer, or technical lead. My current location is {location}.
