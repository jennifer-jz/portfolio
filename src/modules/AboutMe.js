        My official name is Juanjuan Zhao. In workplace, people also call me Jennifer which is my English name.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am an {selfIntroText}
        </p>
        <p>
        I basically spent 10 years in China working in translation industry, out of which 7 years were technology focused, 
        including 3 years as a web development manager and 4 years as a senior software engineer. All my efforts in the period 
        were to build an automated system to help innovate traditional translation workflow and enhance core competitiveness of 
        Cross Language.
        </p>
        <p>
        In 2016, I decided to pursue a master's degree in computer science at University of Texas at Dallas, and graduated in December 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
        Starting from August 2017, I resumed work as a web developer using modern Javascript frameworks, Node, React, Typescript, etc. 
        While being fond of the elegancy and possibilities of modern Javascript frameworks, I quickly grew into a senior software engineer 
        with extensive exposure to web technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
        Also I found myself well adapted to the work environment in US, in particular for communication in workplace, 
        time management, and team leading, based on my previous management experience in Cross Language.
        </p>
        <p>
        I've learned tremendous values by getting involved in agile development tools such as Jira; CICD tools and technologies 
        such as Heroku, Docker, Wercker, and Assembla; version management tools such as Git and SVN; Scaling tools and platforms 
        such AWS autoscaling, GCP, and Kubernetes. Also I highly appreciate modern Javascript libraries which make possible 
        efficient development and clean code: React, ESLint, Webpack, Babel, Styled Components, React Hooks, ES6, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
        Iâ€™m currently open for permanent positions (no contract) in {futureLocation} as a senior software engineer, 
        senior full-stack engineer, or technical lead. My current location is {location}.
